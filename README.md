# Secure Media Folders

## Overview

`secure-media-folders` is a **GUI-based, cross-platform personal utility tool** designed to help users **encrypt and decrypt media folders** (and nested subfolders) using **password-based encryption**. It is intended to **secure your images and videos** without compressing them. Users only need to remember the password used for encryption to decrypt the folders.

This project is perfect for general users seeking privacy, as well as for senior engineers and architects reviewing a lightweight, secure, personal utility.
